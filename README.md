In this challenge two CSV files were read into Python. The task was to create a script to read through each. The first is bank data which the following results were retreived: 
  The total number of months included in the dataset
  The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
  The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
  The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
  The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The second CSV contained election data. The task was to tally up the data and produce the following information:
  The total number of votes cast
  A complete list of candidates who received votes
  The percentage of votes each candidate won
  The total number of votes each candidate won
  The winner of the election based on popular vote
